# OnlineStore

In a couple of hours during the summer of 2020, I programmed a online retail store framework that uses
different classes, all connected to each other, to create a online store experience. 
Moreover, I made sure to keep the data in each class as private, making getter and setter methods necessary to access different data.
Through this project, I was able to practice on my Java skills.
