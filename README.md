# OnlineStore

In a couple of hours during the summer of 2020, I programmed an online retail store framework that uses different classes, all connected to each other, to create an online store experience. Moreover, I made sure to keep the data in each class as private, making getter and setter methods necessary to access different data. Through this project, I was able to practice my Java skills.
